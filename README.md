## Alpha Speed <1.0.0>
Here at SICJY, we value our teamwork and take pride in sticking to the design process. This dedication is what allows us to provide a quality product for consumers of media looking for a new and exciting interactive experience. For this purpose, SICJY would like to introduce Alpha Speed, a video game focused on being a pure skill-based platformer using innovative platforming mechanics to provide a unique experience. Unlike platforming games such as Jump King, which focuses on simple mechanics while heavily punishing the playerâ€™s mistakes, our product allows every kind of player to feel accomplished in developing the unique skills needed to advance in and ultimately complete the game.

## How to Run
Download the source code, and run either the .bat (if on Windows) or .sh (if on Linux) and enjoy the game!
