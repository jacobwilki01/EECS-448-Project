## Alpha Speed <1.0.0>
Here at SICJY, we value our teamwork and take pride in sticking to the design process. This dedication is what allows us to provide a quality product for consumers of media looking for a new and exciting interactive experience. For this purpose, SICJY would like to introduce Alpha Speed, a video game focused on being a pure skill-based platformer using innovative platforming mechanics to provide a unique experience. Unlike platforming games such as Jump King, which focuses on simple mechanics while heavily punishing the playerâ€™s mistakes, our product allows every kind of player to feel accomplished in developing the unique skills needed to advance in and ultimately complete the game.

## How to Run
1. Go into terminal or command prompt and type 'pip install pygame' or install the pygame package in your preferred way.
2. Download the source code, and run either the .bat (if on Windows) or .sh (if on Linux).
3. Enjoy the Game!
